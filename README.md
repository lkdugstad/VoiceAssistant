This is just to publish some Code on my Website. It is overengineering. But interesting on researching how we can build a neural network with translating the comands into Bit strings to predict which category it could be associated with. But as this is a topic of current research it might produce just a big bunch of trash. But maybe an interesting topic for a Bachelorthesis or an Weekend Hackathon (LOL) :D
